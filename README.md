This project focuses on developing a credit card fraud detection system using a Logistic Regression model trained on transaction history data. To address the issue of imbalanced datasets (where fraudulent transactions are typically much rarer than legitimate ones), an under-sampling technique was employed to ensure the model learns effectively from both classes. By analyzing patterns in the transaction data, the system aims to identify fraudulent transactions with a high degree of accuracy, ultimately improving the overall fraud detection rate.
